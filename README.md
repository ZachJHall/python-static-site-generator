# python-static-site-generator

A static site generator I thought I would build for fun.  

It needs ~~a lot of~~ some  work.

Live [site](https://python-static-test.netlify.app/).

# Using *some name*
Place your markdown files into the markdown directory.

Make a copy of the repo on your own account. 

You can easily get the site going by pointing netlify at your own copy of this repo.
